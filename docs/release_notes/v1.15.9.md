- [Ignore 404 errors in transactional Cosmos DB delete operations](#ignore-404-errors-in-transactional-cosmos-db-delete-operations)

## Ignore 404 errors in transactional Cosmos DB delete operations

### Problem

During transactional operations, Dapr sometimes handles deletes on keys that don't exist in Cosmos DB. This is expected behavior, but it was returning errors unnecessarily.

### Impact

Transactional operations could fail when attempting to delete non-existent keys, even though this is a valid scenario that should not cause errors.

### Root cause

The Cosmos DB state store component was not properly handling 404 errors during transactional delete operations, treating them as actual errors instead of expected behavior.

### Solution

Modified the Cosmos DB state store to ignore 404 errors during transactional delete operations, unless there's an explicit requirement for etag checking.
