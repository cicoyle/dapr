- [Fix Global Actors Enabled Configuration](#fix-global-actors-enabled-configuration)


### Problem

## Fix Global Actors Enabled Configuration

### Problem

When `global.actors.enabled` was set to `false` via Helm or the environment variable `ACTORS_ENABLED=false`, the Dapr sidecar would still attempt to connect to the placement service, causing readiness probe failures and repeatedly logged errors about failing to connect to placement.
Fixes this [issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/8551).

### Impact

Dapr sidecars would fail their readiness probes and log errors like:
```
Failed to connect to placement dns:///dapr-placement-server.dapr-system.svc.cluster.local:50005: failed to create placement client: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = last resolver error: produced zero addresses
```

### Root cause

The sidecar injector was not properly respecting the global actors enabled configuration when setting up the placement service connection.

### Solution

The sidecar injector now properly respects the `global.actors.enabled` helm configuration and `ACTORS_ENABLED` environment variable. When set to `false`, it will not attempt to connect to the placement service, allowing the sidecar to start successfully without actor functionality.
