# Pluggable Components APIs

This folder is intended for Pluggable Components. 

These protos are for a feature of Dapr which allows users to write their own components that sit outside of the Daprd binary. [See more on Pluggable Components in the Dapr Docs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/develop-components/pluggable-components/develop-pluggable/).
